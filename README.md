### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- A random lyric snippet is displayed
- 3 artists are displayed, 1 corresponding with lyric snippet
- When the user chooses, the correct answer is revealed
- The score will be tracked

#### PostMVP  

- Create "song mode" where 3 songs titles are used as choices instead of artist name
- Create multi-player mode

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status

|Jan 26| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Jan 27| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Jan 28| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Jan 29| MVP | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
